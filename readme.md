# Lichess.org stylnig extension

This is an extension for Google Chrome browser, that changes the dark theme style of Lichess.org.
I use it for live streaming on twitch. It is designed to work on hd screen with 125% zoom.
It uses javascript for some styling and the code isn't optimal.
Code is just a bunch of hacks on top of each other.
Lichess.org is a free chess website. (https://github.com/ornicar/lila)

[TODO] Move "New Opponent" button functionality into the top left cirlcle symbol.
